# Exploit Development Journey

This is my exploit development journey where I showcase and walk you through the development of over 20 exploits using the Python programming language. The following are list of my exploits:
* [CVE-2009-2265 | ColdFusion 8.0.1 - Arbitrary File Upload to RCE](https://github.com/persian64/CVE-2009-2265)


### Tutorials 
I have also created tutorials on each of these exploits which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt6Tu8Cv_GVdy88CdwEXxZ-oSo6PfHY6G). Bear in mind that the language used in my tutorials is Persian.
